* Base processor architecture = Xtensa LX7
* Tell about Pipelines - 5 stage and 7 stage
* Execute up to eight 32x32-bit MACs (Multiply-Accumulate operations).
* Execute up to sixteen 32x16-bit MACs and sixteen 16x16-bit MACs per cycle, significantly increasing throughput for audio and voice processing tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
* The HiFi 5 DSP architecture has introduced a set of new FLIX formats as part of the RI-2022.9 Xtensa release. These formats are designed to enhance code size and improve performance for various applications, particularly in neural networks (NN) and digital signal processing (DSP) tasks.
* Audio software libraries supplied by Cadence do not use DMA. Hence, most customers either use caches or make local memories sufficiently large to cover desired applications.
* P , Q audio in mini
* Vector loads and stores, content at the high address in memory is always stored in the leastsignificant bits in the register. 
* HiFi 5 DSP also supports three circular buffers that can be used with either aligned or unaligned data.
* Like you said before HifI4 have 4 , Hifi 
* Data Types
    * Scalars, Vectors, and Dual Vectors
    * Element sizes: 8, 16, 24, 32, 64 bits
* When we store the value form memory to the register , the data with high memory address will store in LSB and when we have negative stride the value in least memory will be stored in LSB
* We we do load and store the data cache and internal memory have atleast 2 memory banks . when 2 or more memory access try to reach a same bank the performance will be slower
* Processing stall - the process neeed to
* It have 3 circular buffers
* The compiler also tries to arrange memory accesses smartly to minimize conflicts 
* Connection Box
* AE_LA64.PP - Used to load the data in a aligned way
* If there‚Äôs no banking and no connection box,  and you want to do dual loads or stores, the system needs dual-ported memory.
* AE_LA32X2_IP - Load 2 values in forward direction
* AE_LA32X2_RIP - Load 2 values in revere direction 
* AE_S32X2_IP / RIP - Store
