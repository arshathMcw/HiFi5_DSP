## Fixed and Floating point numbers
* Computer need to represent numbers that are not in integer

* But the above does not represent the 2.8 maybe it make closer (2.8125)
* And also we allocate place for fraction we reduced our dynamic range
* So to avoid this we have floating point
* Fixed point have 2 places (fraction and decimal) but floating point have (Mantissa and Exponent)

* The advantage is that it will give more range than the fixed point
